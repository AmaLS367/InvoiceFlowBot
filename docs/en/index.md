# 📄 InvoiceFlowBot Documentation

InvoiceFlowBot is a Telegram assistant that automates invoice capture for finance teams. Users forward PDFs or photos, the bot extracts a structured draft via Mindee, lets the operator review and edit details, and persists confirmed invoices to SQLite.

The workflow removes repetitive manual entry. Accountants receive a ready draft, adjust header fields or line items, add comments, and store the final version with a single command. Historical queries stay available in the same bot chat.
